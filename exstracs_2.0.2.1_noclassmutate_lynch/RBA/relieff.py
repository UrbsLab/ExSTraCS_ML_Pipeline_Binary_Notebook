Description: ReliefF algorithm computes the score of each attribute evaluating their strength based on k nearest neighbours.  
             Returns a list of attribute scores.
             
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ReBATE V1.0: includes stand-alone Python code to run any of the included/available Relief-Based algorithms designed for attribute filtering/ranking.
These algorithms are a quick way to identify attributes in the dataset that may be most important to predicting some phenotypic endpoint.  These scripts output
an ordered set of attribute names, along with respective scores (uniquely determined by the particular algorithm selected).  Certain algorithms require key
run parameters to be specified.  This code is largely based on the Relief-Based algorithms implemented in the Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) software.
However these implementations have been expanded to accomodate continuous attributes (and continuous attributes mixed with discrete attributes) as well as a 
continuous endpoint.  This code also accomodates missing data points.  Built into this code, is a strategy to automatically detect from the loaded data, these 
relevant characteristics.
