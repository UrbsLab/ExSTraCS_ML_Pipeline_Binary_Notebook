Description: ExSTraCS is best suited to offline iterative learning, however this module has been implemented as an example of how ExSTraCS may be used
             to perform online learning as well.  Here, this module has been written to perform online learning for a n-multiplexer problem, where training
             instances are generated in an online fashion.  This module has not been fully tested.

ExSTraCS V2.0: Extended Supervised Tracking and Classifying System - An advanced LCS designed specifically for complex, noisy classification/data mining tasks, 
such as biomedical/bioinformatics/epidemiological problem domains.  This algorithm should be well suited to any supervised learning problem involving 
classification, prediction, data mining, and knowledge discovery.  This algorithm would NOT be suited to function approximation, behavioral modeling, 
or other multi-step problems.  This LCS algorithm is most closely based on the "UCS" algorithm, an LCS introduced by Ester Bernado-Mansilla and 
Josep Garrell-Guiu (2003) which in turn is based heavily on "XCS", an LCS introduced by Stewart Wilson (1995).
