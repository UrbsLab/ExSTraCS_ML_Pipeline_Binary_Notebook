Description: Used for global evaluations of the LCS rule population for problem domains with a discrete phenotype.  Allows for the calculation of balanced
             accuracy when a discrete phenotype includes two or more possible classes.

ExSTraCS V2.0: Extended Supervised Tracking and Classifying System - An advanced LCS designed specifically for complex, noisy classification/data mining tasks, 
such as biomedical/bioinformatics/epidemiological problem domains.  This algorithm should be well suited to any supervised learning problem involving 
classification, prediction, data mining, and knowledge discovery.  This algorithm would NOT be suited to function approximation, behavioral modeling, 
or other multi-step problems.  This LCS algorithm is most closely based on the "UCS" algorithm, an LCS introduced by Ester Bernado-Mansilla and 
Josep Garrell-Guiu (2003) which in turn is based heavily on "XCS", an LCS introduced by Stewart Wilson (1995).
