    "# A Rigorous Machine Learning Pipeline (Supervised Binary Classification):\n",
    "* Author: Ryan Urbanowicz, PhD \n",
    "*  Affiliation: University of Pennsylvania - Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics & Institute for Biomedical Informatics (IBI) \n",
    "* Date: 8/25/20\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook presents an example of a 'rigorous' machine learning (ML) analysis pipeline that could be reasonablly applied to various supervised learning classification tasks. This pipeline was developed with biomedical data mining/modeling in mind. While this pipeline offers a comprehensive and rigorous proposed analysis, we do not suggest that this is necessarily the 'best' or 'only' way to conduct an appropriate binary classification ML analysis. \n",
    "***\n",
    "## Environment Requirements\n",
    "In order to run this pipeline as a Jupyter Notebook you must have the proper environment set up on your computer. Python 3 as well as a number of Python packages are required.  Most of these requirements are satisfied by installing the most recent version of anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). We used Anaconda3 with python version 3.7.7 during this pipeline development. In addition to the packages included in anaconda, the following packages will need to be installed separately (or possibly updated, if you have an older version installed):\n",
    "\n",
    "* scikit-rebate (To install: pip install skrebate)\n",
    "* xgboost (To install: pip install xgboost)\n",
    "* lightgbm (To install: pip install lightgbm)\n",
    "* optuna (To install: pip install optuna)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, while currently commented out in the file (modeling_methods.py) if you want the optuna hypterparameter sweep figures to appear within the jupyter notebook (via the command 'fig.show()' ) you will need to run the following installation commands.  This should only be required if you edit the python file to uncomment this line for any or all of the ML modeling algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "* pip install -U plotly>=4.0.0\n",
    "* conda install -c plotly plotly-orca\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in order to include the stand-alone algorithm 'ExSTraCS' we needed to call this from the command line within this Jupyter Notebook.  As a result, the part of this notebook running ExSTraCS will only run properly if the path to the working directory used to run this notebook includes no spaces.  In other words if your path includes a folder called 'My Folder' vs. 'My_Folder' you will likely get a run error for ExSTraCS (at least on a Windows machine). Thus, make sure to check that wherever you are running this notebook from, that the entire path to the working directory does note include any spaces. \n",
    "***\n",
    "## Dataset Requirements\n",
    "This notebook loads a single dataset to be run through the entire pipeline. Here we summarize the requirements for this dataset:\n",
    "* Ensure your data is in a single file: (If you have a pre-partitioned training/testing dataset, you should combine them into a single dataset before running this notebook)\n",
    "* Any dataset specific cleaning, feature transformation, or feature engineering that may be needed in order to maximize ML performance should be conducted by the user separately or added to the beginning of this notebook. \n",
    "* The dataset should be in tab-delimited .txt format to run this notebook (as is).  Commented-out code to load a comma separated file (.csv) and excel file (.xlsx) is included in the notebook as an alternative. \n",
    "* Missing data values should be empty or indicated with an 'NA'.\n",
    "* Dataset includes a header with column names. This should include a column for the binary class label and (optionally) a column for the instance ID, as well as columns for other 'features', e.g. independend variables. \n",
    "* The class labels should be 0 for the major class (i.e. the most frequent class), and 1 for the minor class.  This is important for generation of the precision/recall curve (PRC) plots. \n",
    "* This dataset is saved in the working directory containing the jupyter notebook file, and all other files in this repository.\n",
    "* All variables in the dataset have been numerically encoded (otherwise additional data preprocessing may be needed)\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Notebook Organization\n",
    "#### Part 1: Exploratory analysis, data cleaning, and creating n-fold CV partitioned datasets \n",
    "- Instances missing a class value are excluded\n",
    "- The user can indicate other columns that should be excluded from the analysis\n",
    "- The user can turn on/off the option to apply standard scaling to the data prior to CV partitioning or imputation\n",
    "    - We use no scaling by default. This is because most methods should work properly without it, and in applying the model downstream, it is difficult to properly scale new data so that models may be re-applied later.\n",
    "    - ANN modeling is sensitive to feature scaling, thus without it, performance not be as good. However this is only one of many challenges in getting ANN to perform well. \n",
    "- The user can turn on/off the option to impute missing values following CV partitioning\n",
    "- The user can turn on/off the option for the code to automatically attempt to discriminate nominal from ordinal features\n",
    "- The user can choose the number of CV partitions as well as the strategy for CV partitioning (i.e.  random (R), stratified (S), and matched (M) \n",
    "- CV training and testing datasets are saved as .txt files so that the same partitions may be analyzed external to this code\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Part 2: Feature selection\n",
    "- The user can turn on/off the option to filter out the lowest scoring features in the data (i.e. to conduct not just feature importance evaluation but feature selection)\n",
    "- Feature importance evaluation and feature selection are conducted within each respective CV training partition\n",
    "- The pipeline reports feature importance estimates via two feature selection algorithms:\n",
    "    - Mutual Information: Proficient at detecting univariate associations\n",
    "    - MultiSURF: Proficient at detecting univariate associations, 2-way epistatic interactions, and heterogeneous associations\n",
    "    \n",
    "- When selected by the user, feature selection conservatively keeps any feature identified as 'potentially relevant' (i.e. score > 0) by either algorithm\n",
    "- Since MultiSURF scales quadratically with the number of training instances, there is an option to utilize a random subset of instances when running this algorithm to save computational time\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Part 3: Machine learning modeling\n",
    "- Seven ML modeling algorithms have been implemented in this pipeline:\n",
    "    - Logistic Regression (scikit learn)\n",
    "    - Decision Tree (scikit learn)\n",
    "    - Random Forest (scikit learn)\n",
    "    - Naïve Bayes (scikit learn)\n",
    "    - XGBoost (separate python package)\n",
    "    - LightGBM (separate python package)\n",
    "    - SVM (scikit learn)\n",
    "    - ANN (scikit learn)\n",
    "    - ExSTraCS (v2.0.2.1) - a Learning Classifier System (LCS) algorithm manually configured to run in this notebook\n",
    "- User can select any subset of these methods to run\n",
    "- ML modeling is conducted within each respective CV training partition on the respective feature subset selected within the given CV partition\n",
    "- ML modeling begins with a hyperparameter sweep conducted with a grid search of hard coded run parameter options (user can edit as needed)\n",
    "- Balanced accuracy is applied as the evaluation metric for the hyperparameter sweep\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 4: ML feature importance vizualization\n",
