# ExSTraCS_ML_Pipeline_Binary_Notebook
An rigorous, well documented machine learning (ML) analysis pipeline for binary classification datasets assembled as a Jupyter Notebook. Includes exploratory analysis, data processing, feature processing, ML modeling (11 algorithms, including the original ExSTraCS algorithm) with hyperparameter sweeps, visualizations, and statistical analysis. A comprehensive starting point to adapt to your own dataset an as an example of how to integrate a non-scikit-learn ML algorithm into a comparative pipeline.

This version of our binary ML pipeline was developed in particular for a study of pancreatic cancer in collaboration with Dr. Shannon Lynch.  The goal was to develop a rigorous ML pipeline to compare performance of our heterogeneity sensitive learning classifier system algorithm (i.e. ExSTraCS) to other well known ML algorithms, and simultaneously to investigate how ML algorithms deal with bias in a complex biomedical problem.
