# ExSTraCS_ML_Pipeline_Binary_Notebook
An rigorous, well documented machine learning analysis pipeline for binary classification datasets assembled as a Jupyter Notebook. Includes exploratory analysis, data processing, feature processing, ML modeling (11 algorithms, including the original ExSTraCS algorithm) with hyperparameter sweeps, visualizations, and statistical analysis. A comprehensive starting point to adapt to your own dataset an as an example of how to integrate a non-scikit-learn ML algorithm into a comparative pipeline.
